# üåè Immigration & relocation

Being location independent means you could decide to move away from where we first hired you, and that's okay. Status can provide you with confirmation of employment/engagement letters if you need them in the process of migrating abroad.

However, we cannot cover the visa/work permit processing or relocation costs as we're location agnostic for work. In case of relocation due to business reasons (i.e., we *really, really* need you to, and you agree to it), we will take care of all the processes and costs involved.

## What happens if I'm thinking about relocating

Get in touch with People Ops to start a discussion about your relocation plans for potential contract considerations. We are sometimes limited in the number of local employment contracts we can offer to foreign nationals.

If you're switching to a local employment contract that results in additional employer tax costs to Status (i.e CH/DE), we will offer you an adjusted (decreased) base salary calculated to keep the cost impact for Status neutral.

## If you need company details

If you need to indicate your employment/occupation details on a visa application, please use the Status entity address as your employment contract or consulting agreement.

Please only refer to Status as your employer if the DE/CH entity formally employs you. Otherwise, you should indicate that you are self-employed or providing services as a freelance contractor, as appropriate.

If you need to indicate a company representative on your application, feel free to contact People Ops for details.
