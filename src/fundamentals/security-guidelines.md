# üîê Security guidelines

Security is a priority at Status, and we'd like to thank you in advance for taking steps to secure your devices and online accounts. 

Here you'll find helpful links to resources to protect yourself and the organization from attackers. 

> In much the same way we've decentralized the organization and applications, we've done the same for security.
>
> It means the vast majority of the attack surface is you, the people that contribute. Furthermore, the controls and information a security specialist has in terms of making decisions and monitoring how things are run is constrained. It also means education takes a forward step in importance across the organization, and personal responsibility of quality security practices become paramount. It is up the people to understand potential threats, take preventative measures, and report any issues they come across to the security team to protect the organization as a whole.

## Ask for help

Above all else, never be afraid to ask for help, ask questions, or report security concerns. Until we have an official infrastructure for support tickets, drop by:

   * #security for more broad, public questions.
   * #security-internal for anything that is more private.
   * Drop an email to `security@status.im` if none of the above channels fit.

All contributors with an onboarding process will have a security touchpoing with the security team during the first month of their onboarding.

## Best practices checklists

Review & follow this [checklist](https://github.com/status-im/status-security/blob/master/process/personal-security-checklist.md) to make sure you are complying with our best practices.

Phishing attacks are the most common: discord bots, telegram messages, and email, amongst other channels. Take this [phishing test](https://phishingquiz.withgoogle.com/) to see how savvy you are when it comes to detecting phishing.

## Hardware

Check out this [list](https://notes.status.im/zkr20eWFTwGD92xixGX2CA) of essential hardware. Core contributors can expense hardware security keys (yubikeys) and should be used for Github, Gsuite, and Bitwarden.

Here's Corey's Status Learn-Up session about [hardware wallets and best practices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nzqntuFR44&ab_channel=HashingItOut).

## Password manager

Our password manager is [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/). All organizational passwords should be kept and shared here. So if you plan to store a Status related password, or get access to platforms that require username/passwords/2fa, then it should all be shared using Bitwarden.

You can request an invite in #people-ops. By signing up with the organization, you get the premium features and sign up with any email you like. That way, if you ever leave Status, you can take your password manager secrets with you, and you only lose access to Status related items.
