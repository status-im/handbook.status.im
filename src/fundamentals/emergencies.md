# ☢️ In case of emergency
Although we don't usually encounter emergencies (and that's why they're exceptional situations), when they happen, it's good if we all know how to react to them. 

Here you'll find helpful information about what to do and expect from each other in case of emergency.

## Keep your contact information up to date

We'll use your emergency contact info in [Bamboo](https://statusim.bamboohr.com/) if we ever need an emergency contact for you. Please keep it up to date! Navigate to `My info` > `Emergency Contact` to maintain it.

It's also helpful to review your contact phone number and email address from time to time if we need to reach you directly.

## Status emergency contacts

In all emergencies, contact people-ops@status.im or ping someone from the People Ops team directly via DM (or phone for urgent matters) for immediate attention. The People Ops team will coordinate with others (i.e., legal or security) on your behalf when needed.  

## In case of a medical emergency

We don't have a centralized medical emergency provision. We recommend that you get [travel insurance](./working-here/traveling-for-status.md) out before any Status-sponsored travel, which usually includes emergency medical cover.

Please contact People Ops if you find yourself in medical difficulties. We may not always provide onsite assistance, but we'll be happy to help with what we can and manage internal communication with your team.

## In case of a legal emergency

In the rare case that you encounter any legal difficulties in connection with your capacity as a service provider to Status, such as:

  * Arrest or detention,
  * Receiving a notice or subpoena from a government authority,
  * Questioning at airports/country borders, or
  * Contract disputes or lawsuits;

Please get in touch with us. We'll do our best to support and guide you through whatever situation you're faced with and have a reserve set aside for this purpose.

## Best practices crossing borders

Here are some general guidelines when crossing borders.

  * Before traveling, be aware of which countries may detain you and search your devices (even if only transiting through). The US and Canada are known for this, though this applies in many other countries. It's helpful information so that you're aware of your rights and what can/can't legally be asked of you when crossing a border. Be mindful of what is on your devices and could be potentially accessed.
  * We'd always recommend complying with border officials and answering their questions truthfully.
  * In case you get asked to supply passwords or open devices, what you should do next really depends on the country's laws. Still, generally speaking, you have more rights and options if you are a citizen returning home than a foreign national (who may not have a choice to decline). If you are a citizen, refusing to comply may lead to prolonged detention or having your device(s) seized. If you need legal advice, please contact the Legal team.
  * If you have to give your password to a Status device to border officials or have a device seized, please let us know to review the security implications and manage accounts accordingly.
  * Please be aware of the difference between a business trip and working, for immigration purposes, when traveling for Status. Telling a border official that you are coming to their country for "work" often implies that you are doing revenue-generating activities in their country, i.e., that you would require a work permit. A "business trip" clarifies that your center of economic activity remains outside the country and that you are merely visiting for short-term purposes to do activities auxiliary to your job. 
  * Most countries will expect that you have an onward flight within the period of your legal stay and that you have at least six months remaining validity on your passport. You may want to renew your passport before travel if it expires soon and avoid traveling on one-way tickets.
  * If you hold a passport that frequently runs up against increased border scrutiny, we'll be happy to write you a letter for any Status-related trips you go on in which we explain your purpose in the country.
