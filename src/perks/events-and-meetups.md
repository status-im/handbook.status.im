# 🎤 Events and meetups

As a Status contributor, you'll be speaking at or attending external online or in-person events. Or you or a team lead will be organizing team or project-specific meetups to work together in person. 

The community is an essential part of the Web3 ecosystem. Ecosystem, domain-specific, and internal events and meetups are networking and growth opportunities. And we strongly encourage you to be part of them!

Here you'll find helpful information to make the most out of organizing, speaking, or attending an event representing Status.


## What events does Status sponsor

Status will sponsor and cover the costs for any online or in-person event with a clear purpose. That means it must align with our company's strategy and goals. That is, but not limited to:

   * Ecosystem events such as DevCon, ETH[city], ETHCC, Hackathons, blockchain weeks, etc.
   * Domain-specific events for your role for career purposes.
   * Events and meetups for hiring purposes.
   * Internal events and meetups to prepare a product/project launch or work together.
   * Moderating or speaking opportunities related to Status.

> ✨ Remember that when you're in an event, you're representing Status and everyone who shares our values. Don't forget that and spread the word! Who knows who's listening and might contribute or join Status thanks to you :)

## How to communicate an event

The events and travel budgets come from your team's budget. As a first step, you should check with your team lead about the event or meetup. 

As per our transparency and resourcefulness principles, we ask everyone to post their event plans and goals to Discuss. The post should include:

   * Event details: where, when, who's attending, one line about the event.
   * Whether or not Status is an official sponsor and why.
   * What are the goals of attending the event and a project brief, if it makes sense.
   * Who you'll need support from the team for design, comms, documentation, etc.
   * Anything else you consider relevant!

Here's a event [post example]("https://discuss.status.im/t/ethdenver-feb-15-17-2019/922").

## If it falls outside your team's budget

Submit the request in the #travel-requests channel and tag (as cc) your team lead. From there, your team lead can give a simple 👍 to confirm the request makes sense or ask additional questions; and People Ops & Finance can ask any necessary questions or suggest adjustments.
