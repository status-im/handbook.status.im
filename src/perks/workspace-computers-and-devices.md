# üñ• Workspace, computers, and devices

Having the proper setup is fundamental to ensure you can work comfortably and avoid getting into long-standing consequences. Since we're all working remotely, you can choose what suits you best within a budget. If you're a core contributor at Status, we'll provide you with the tools required to succeed in your role during your onboarding. 

Here you'll find helpful information to set yourself up with the devices and home office equipment you need.

## ‚òëÔ∏è Pre-approved equipment

All core contributors have a list of pre-approved workspace and equipment budgets. That means you do not need prior approval from Finance to expense up to the pre-approved amount. We defined the amounts to cover a range of options, so you will stay below that budget in most cases. When that happens, note that pre-approved amounts aren't "balances," and you can't spend the difference for other stuff.

The standard setup for everyone includes a laptop, a display, a desk, and an ergonomic chair. You might also need additional phones or laptops for business or testing purposes which you can also request reimbursement. 

Before purchasing anything, check if there's already a suitable item in our [inventory](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A2jqn3Ch-zDyHFRnqMaoWwVHKBAPgH2p4sgEWk7Jwyo/edit?ts=5c2cbe52#gid=0). Also, consider refurbished devices and purchasing in trusted secondary markets for testing phones or other things that make sense. 

   * Laptop: 2000 EUR
   * External monitor: 500 EUR
   * Desk and ergonomic chair: 600 EUR
   * Mic and headphones: 100 EUR
   * Testing phones: 200 EUR
   * Keycard: ping @guylouis to get a code 

If your workspace and equipment needs fall outside the pre-approved budgets, [create a budget request]() for approval. For additional equipment, check with your team lead, then add the approval details in your reimbursement. Some examples of other equipment:

   * A printer for an ops role
   * A digital sketchpad for a design role
   * A business phone for a biz dev role

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è If you're unsure whether or not this applies to you, ping People Ops. We occasionally have loan assets available to all contributors. 

## üéÅ How to get your workspace equipment and devices

   1. Let People Ops know the devices you will purchase two weeks before your start date, during your onboarding, or when you need them. 
   2. Choose official or trusted vendors to buy your equipment.
   3. Go to your `profile > assets` in BambooHR and `Add assets,` filling all device information.
   4. Once registered, request a refund by adding the expense to Expensify and your next invoice.
   5. You can reimburse custom expenses. Try to avoid international shipping when possible. Buy from vendors within your country or economic area. 

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è FAQ

   * **What if I'm a German employee?**

      If you're a German employee, please be sure to buy your devices via an invoice addressed to the German entity (Status Research & Development Deutschland GmbH, ‚ÑÖ Cormoran GmbH, Am Zirkus 2, 10117 Berlin, Germany). The invoice should be submitted to billing@status.im.

   * **What if I don't have enough funds to buy the device before reimbursement?**
   
      If cash flow is an issue and you'd prefer not to outlay the cash upfront for your new device, please ping People Ops. We'll help you with the purchase.
   
   * **What if my devices become outdated?**
   
      At the 3 year mark, if your device needs an upgrade, ping People Ops.
      
   * **What happens if I accidentally damage a device?**

      You should treat the devices as if they were yours. If the damage was due to factors beyond your control, please obtain a quote for a repair and let People Ops know. If the cost is reasonable (i.e., less than ~75% of the trade-in value of the asset), we would ask you to go ahead and get the device repaired. Then, submit the repair expense cost for reimbursement.
      
   * **What if I leave Status?**
