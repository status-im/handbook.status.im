# üèì Coworking Allowance

The coworking allowance offers core contributors some flexibility to find a workspace different from your [home office](/src/perks/computers-and-devices.md) if needed. It's non-transferrable for other expenses in case you don't make use of it.

You can expense up to 300 USD (or local currency equivalent) per month for coworking costs.

You can spend your allowance on:

   * A coworking space rental/hotdesk/access pass.
   * Coffees/teas at spaces where you use the wifi.

You can't use the allowance for:

   * Covering additional bills arising from you working from home.
   * Your internet/broadband costs.
   * Meals.

Please keep the invoices/receipts and submit your costs through Expensify as per the [expense reimbursement guidelines](/src/finance/expense-reimbursement.md), specifying Coworking as the Category detailing the expense in the comments field of your expense line item. 

If your coworking cost is above budget, please only expense up to that amount in your expense claim.

Please also consider that (for smaller/less frequent coworking expenses), our minimum threshold for submitting an expense report is 50 USD. As such, we'd ask you to group coffee receipts into one batch of at least 50 USD before submitting them for processing.
