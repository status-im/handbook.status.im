## ℹ️ FAQ

   * **What if I don't have enough funds to buy the device before reimbursement?**
   
      If cash flow is an issue and you'd prefer not to outlay the cash upfront for your new device, please ping People Ops. We'll help you with the purchase.
   
   * **What if my devices become outdated?**
   
      At the 3 year mark (or earlier, please check with your team lead), if your device needs an upgrade, ping People Ops.
      
   * **What happens if I accidentally damage a device?**

      You should treat the devices as if they were yours. If the damage was due to factors beyond your control, please obtain a quote for a repair and let People Ops know. If the cost is reasonable (i.e., less than ~75% of the trade-in value of the asset), we would ask you to go ahead and get the device repaired. Then, submit the repair expense cost for reimbursement.
