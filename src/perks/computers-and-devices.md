# üñ• Computers and devices

Having the proper setup is fundamental to ensuring you can work comfortably. Since we're all working remotely, you can choose what suits you best within a budget. If you're a core contributor at Status, we'll provide you with the tools required to succeed in your role during your onboarding. 

Here you'll find helpful information to set yourself up with the computers and devices you need.

## ‚òëÔ∏è Pre-approved equipment

All core contributors have a list of pre-approved equipment budgets previously considered within their team budgets. That means you do not need prior approval from Finance to expense up to the pre-approved amount. Let your team lead know about your equipment purchasing plans. Follow the instructions below to get your computer and other devices.

The standard setup for everyone includes a laptop, headphones, a Keycard, a Yubikey, and a Ledger. 

We defined the amounts to cover a range of options, so you will stay below that budget in most cases. When that happens, note that pre-approved amounts aren't "balances," and you can't spend the difference for other stuff.

   * Laptop: up to 2000 EUR
   * Mic and headphones: up to 100 EUR
   * Keycard: ping the #keycard channel to get a code 
   * Yubikey: you can reimburse one
   * Ledger: you can reimburse one

Check beforehand if there's already a suitable item in our [inventory](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A2jqn3Ch-zDyHFRnqMaoWwVHKBAPgH2p4sgEWk7Jwyo/edit?ts=5c2cbe52#gid=0). Also, consider refurbished devices and purchasing in trusted secondary markets for things that make sense. 

For additional funds per item or other equipment, check with your team lead, and add the approval details to your reimbursement. If your equipment needs fall outside your team's budget, you can [request funds](/src/finance/request-funds.md) for approval. Some examples of other equipment:

   * Testing phones for engineering roles
   * A printer for an ops role
   * A digital sketchpad for a design role
   * A business phone for a biz dev role

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è If you're unsure whether or not this applies to you, ping People Ops. We occasionally have loan assets available to all contributors. 

## üéÅ How to get your computers and devices

   1. Let your team lead and People Ops know the devices you will purchase two weeks before your start date, during your onboarding, or when you need them. 
   2. Choose official or trusted vendors to buy your equipment.
   3. Go to your `profile > assets` in BambooHR and `Add assets,` filling all device information.
   4. Once registered, request a refund by adding the expense to Expensify and your next invoice.
   5. You can reimburse custom expenses. Try to avoid international shipping when possible. Buy from vendors within your country or economic area. 

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è FAQ

   * **What if I'm a German employee?**

      If you're a German employee, please be sure to buy your devices via an invoice addressed to the German entity (Status Research & Development Deutschland GmbH, ‚ÑÖ Cormoran GmbH, Am Zirkus 2, 10117 Berlin, Germany). The invoice should be submitted to billing@status.im.

   * **What if I don't have enough funds to buy the device before reimbursement?**
   
      If cash flow is an issue and you'd prefer not to outlay the cash upfront for your new device, please ping People Ops. We'll help you with the purchase.
   
   * **What if my devices become outdated?**
   
      At the 3 year mark, if your device needs an upgrade, ping People Ops.
      
   * **What happens if I accidentally damage a device?**

      You should treat the devices as if they were yours. If the damage was due to factors beyond your control, please obtain a quote for a repair and let People Ops know. If the cost is reasonable (i.e., less than ~75% of the trade-in value of the asset), we would ask you to go ahead and get the device repaired. Then, submit the repair expense cost for reimbursement.
      
   * **What if I leave Status?**

      Please check out [this offboarding guide](/src/settling-in/offboarding.md) for your options on recycling or buying back your laptop.
