# üè¶ Requesting funding

From time to time, you might need to request additional funds to get work done. As a general principle, we ask teams to anticipate their spending as part of the monthly budgeting exercise. This is so that teams can be self-sufficient and make their own decisions about spending without checking each expense with Finance.

This guide is about how to request funding when:

   * The team budget has been exceeded and additional funds are required; OR
   * Unanticipated/new expenses arise; OR
   * Approval is needed on a time-sensitive basis that can't wait for regular team budget reviews.

This applies to all mechanisms of receiving funding, including:

   * Putting an expense on the company credit card; OR
   * Getting crypto (SNT/ETH) paid out to your wallet; OR
   * Putting a non-routine expense on your personal card and having it reimbursed via Expensify.
