# üëë Your most important role

There are many ways you can help Status grow: engaging with the community, interviewing, helping out with events, etc., but referring outstanding people is one of the most direct ways you can make an impact.

As an organization, we're reliant on many groups to help us reach our goals: freelancers, community members, testers, researchers, users, and more. We need these groups who make hugely valuable contributions and Core Contributors who work with Status on a full-time or contract basis.

Hiring Core Contributors that align with our values and excel in their field is essential to us ‚Äìand we'd love your help! Here you'll find helpful information to connect extraordinary people you know with Status.

## Referral bonus

If you've worked with someone amazing and think they would be a great fit here at Status, not only would we like to know, but we'll also reward you once they've successfully completed their trial period.

We will reward you an SNT referral bonus of $5000 after the candidate has been with Status as a core contributor for three months. At times, we might offer higher rewards for specific critical roles, so stay tuned for updates in the Town Halls and #people-ops channel!

### Eligibility criteria

   * Of course, you can't refer yourself (nice try!) ;)
   * You can only refer candidates that have not applied to us within the last 90 days.
   * Referrals are for individuals ‚Äìwe are not responsible for any fees related to resumes received from recruitment agencies.
   * The initial contact between us and your referral must be facilitated by you. If someone is already known to us or is in the middle of the hiring process, we wouldn't consider it a new referral.
   * The referral bonus only applies to hiring core contributors that join us on a full-time or long-term basis. It does not apply to hiring part-time or short-term contractors.

Sorry for the many conditions! We're want to be fair and apply some common-sense guidelines, but let us know if you have any better ideas! :)

## How to make a referral

Here are the basics of referring incredible people to join Status:

   * Use [Pinpoint](https://statusim.pinpointhq.com/referrals/users/sign_up) to refer someone you know, and make sure to add their contact information, CV, and where and why you think they'd be great for Status. The team reads the notes when reviewing referrals, so this can help them stand out among other qualified candidates.
      * Ask the Talent team to give you access if the link isn't working for you.
      * While you should share people whose work you can speak to and are impressed by (i.e., the top 25% of people you've worked with), don't feel pressured to refer everyone who asks. If you feel uncomfortable saying no (we get it, it can be awkward), you can mention it in the notes in the referral form.
   *  The recruiting team will take good care of them and keep you posted on their progress through the hiring process. Still, you can be a critical layer of support to them by:
      * Helping them prep for interviews or activities.
      * Answering questions about working at Status and your experiences.
      * If they get an offer, help us convince them to accept it!

> ‚ú® Diverse perspectives, backgrounds, and experiences lead to better products. When you refer talent from underrepresented groups, particularly into technical positions, you're doing your part to build a diverse workforce across all functions and levels.

## It doesn't always work out

While referrals do have a much higher pass-through rate than regular applications, there may be a chance that your referral doesn't end up joining Status. This might happen due to:

   * Timing: their qualifications don't match the roles currently available.
   * Matching: they don't meet all of the minimum requirements listed for the role.
   * Competition: there was someone else who was more qualified.
   * Demand: the role was reduced or closed.
   * Referrals who eventually join the project are typically considered for multiple roles over a period of time before we extend them an offer.
