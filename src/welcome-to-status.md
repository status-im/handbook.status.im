# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Status

Status was created to:

* Ease the transition to a more open mobile internet.
* Help anyone, anywhere, interact with Ethereum, requiring no more than a phone.
* Foster links with the wider Ethereum DApp community and showcase what the ecosystem has to offer.

## Vision

Today, when you are first exposed to Status, you might see an instant messenger and wonder, "What's the big deal? After all, itâ€™s just another instant messenger, right? What makes Status different and more importantly why should I bother working on it?"

If I had to answer in one word, I would say Decentralization.

Now, that word might not have much meaning to you - it might even sound like a buzzword - but in our context, Decentralization has the potential fundamentally to change the way we organize socially and to rebuild the Internet as it was originally imagined â€“ a commons for innovation. By decentralizing all the things, we are changing the very foundation of civilization, providing a new infrastructural base that impacts everything else above, from our greatest institutions to our daily social interactions.

Status is our gateway to this new world. Let me explain. [Read the Founderâ€™s Statement â†’](https://github.com/status-im/legacy-wiki/blob/master/archive/Founder%E2%80%99s_Statement.md)

## A Letter to Status by Jarrad Hope 

This is a draft, published early for the Townhall, still proofreading and adding to it.

So we're getting to an organization level where broadcasting communication is probably the most effective to reach everyone, and often I take it for granted that I've been with the project for longest, and quite frankly there was many years of experience, reading, thinking and research that lead to our project's creation. And I realize now my role should be mostly that of an educator, at least what I (think I) know, and I certainly don't know much at all.

I'm going to take a few weeks off, mostly just to pause and reflect on Status and life, but before I check out I wanted to write up a little bit about the world as I see it and provide some thoughts on various aspects, this is about as close to the strategy/north star document will get from my contributions, I do encourage for you to take these ideas and make them your own.

So here I am, writing a letter to you (and to myself).

Before I continue, you need to know that what I say isn't gospel, Status is just as much yours as it is mine. You are an active participant and I invite you to actively shape it as your own. That is the nature of an open-source project, and that idea extends beyond just code. What I can only do, is do my best to guide and give suggestions. Remember, you via Status are entrusted by the greater community to build a collective good. Let's do right by them and by our own self-determination.

tl;dr: it's a memory dump, read it. [Read Jarradâ€™s Letter to Status â†’](https://our.status.im/a-letter-to-status-context-strategy/)
