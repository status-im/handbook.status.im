# Introduction

The Status Network is an open set of projects building peer-to-peer technologies for people to transact securely and communicate freely. We build decentralized technologies ranging from protocol-level infrastructure to consumer applications — forming an open-source peer-to-peer technology stack.

The [Status](https://status.im/get/) app is a secure communication tool that upholds human rights. Designed to enable the free flow of information, protect the right to private, secure conversations, and promote the sovereignty of individuals. [Discover more projects →](https://statusnetwork.com/)

### Contributing

Status is an open community, you don’t need to ask permission to join or become a member. If you see something you think should be improved, you can [make a PR](https://github.com/status-im/),  join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/2HyyjgFHVK) or create a [a proposal](https://discuss.status.im/) and make it happen.

You can also contribute to specific Status Network projects such as [Waku Connect](https://wakuconnect.dev/) or [Nimbus](https://nimbus.team/). As an open-source project, we are location-agnostic and operate fully remote. You can find what profiles each project is looking for [on this page](https://jobs.status.im/).
