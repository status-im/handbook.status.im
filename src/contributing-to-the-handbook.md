# ðŸš€ Contributing to the handbook

The handbook is an open living repo built for you. The truth is Status evolves faster than it does the documentation. Read it carefully, and feel free to add sections, suggest changes, or make proposals for others to edit. 

Here are you'll find helpful guidelines on how to contribute to the handbook and make it yours!

## ðŸ‘¾ Contributing with pull requests

Whether you'd like to fix typos, update information, add sections, or build new content, you can create a pull request to contribute to the handbook. 

Our current workflow has two main branches: `mater` that deploys to `[handbook.status.im](https://handbook.status.im)` and `develop` that deploys to `[dev-handbook.status.im](https://dev-handbook.status.im)`. 

Before creating a pull request, create a new branch from `develop` and commit your changes to one or multiple PRs. Once finished, assign someone from the People Ops team to review or comment on it. Once merged, we'll delete the branch, and you'll see your contributions on the handbook!

## ðŸ“Œ Leaving feedback with issues

Issues open a world of possibilities: from proposing changes to simply dropping an idea or leaving comments or tasks. 

There are a few ways to create an issue:

   * Go to the `issues` tab in the handbook repo and create one.
   * From the source code of a file, click the `+` sign at the beginning of a line.
   * From a comment from a pull request, click `reference in new issue`.

Just like a PR, assign the issue to someone from the People Ops team, and we'll tag/re-assign it accordingly to address it.

The People Ops team keeps the handbook's maintenance, but it's really a collective effort. So please help us make it better for you and future readers!
