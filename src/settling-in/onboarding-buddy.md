# üß≠ Onboarding buddy

We've created the buddy program to make the onboarding process in a remote team as warm and welcoming as possible. A buddy is there to connect new joiners, solve doubts as they appear, and immerse new contributors into our culture from the lenses of someone who's helped shape it.

Here you'll find helpful information about what you can expect from your buddy and how to become a successful one.

## How we match buddies

The buddy system is role and location agnostic. We want folks across the organization to have the chance to meet and get to know others outside of those they'd work with regularly. 

That means you may get paired with someone that has an entirely different role to you. The buddying conversations don't need to be technical. New contributors should have a team who will get them set up with a project in their first weeks. The buddy program focuses on the contributor experience, broader community, ecosystem, Status culture, vision, and mission.

Suppose a new contributor still has lots of questions about their work responsibilities or role. In that case, you can help them connect with the right person to solve them.

If the timezone difference makes it hard to pair, please let People Ops know, and we'll reassign a new buddy in a closer region.


## For new contributors

As a new contributor, it's not always easy to find a tenured peer to walk you through all things Status. We will match you with a buddy! You can find their username in BambooHR to send them a message to introduce yourself and set up recurrent calls during your first 4-6 weeks. There's nothing for you to prepare or do in advance of the weekly buddy calls:

   * Your buddy will be ready to guide you on contributing to Status.
   * The buddy chats are a safe space for you to ask whatever you'd like about working at Status --no topic too trivial or complex!
   * Feel free to note as many questions as you like --you can ask these to your buddy either in your weekly chats or any time via DM.


## For buddies

Anyone can signup as a buddy. Normally, People Ops will reach out to propose you to pair with a new contributor prior or during their first days of onboarding.

Offsites are a fantastic way to get to know people, so let's try to give the same vibe even if we're stuck for travel!


**Time commitment**

It depends on you and the person you will be buddying, but we expect it to be about 1 hour each week, for the first 4-6 weeks.


**What makes a good buddy?**

A good buddy is someone prepared to be a friendly support, an informal source of information on how the project works, and someone ready to share their experience.

There's no set amount of time you should have worked with Status before becoming a buddy --everyone is very welcome to volunteer by reaching out to People Ops.


**Roles and responsibilities of a buddy**

   * As a buddy, you are not 'managing' that individual but a supportive colleague and friendly face.
   * Helping your new colleague to navigate their way around Status.
   * Answering questions ‚Äì often more than once. Buddies need to be patient as new starters take in a lot of information, often in a short time, and may need to re-ask questions in the future as events occur.
   * Provide information, signpost information, and informal support.
   * Introducing them to other contributors who are relevant to their role.
   * Helping them to understand the formal and informal culture and structures at Status.
   * Getting the newbie comfortable with Status products and principles.
   * Encourage them to ask questions if unsure about any aspects of their role. 
   * When possible, arrange to meet up for coworking in the area, or introduce them to any other Status team members in their area. 
   * Flag to People Ops topics or situations that seem confusing for new hires, so we can tackle them better and faster!
   * Be a general all-round Status legend and share your love and passion for the project.


**Guidelines for approaching the first meeting**

If you haven't been a buddy before, don't panic or feel overwhelmed as the new joiner may have similar feelings. Remember every bit of knowledge and advice is valuable to the success of the new starter!

On the new contributor's first few days with Status, People Ops will arrange an onboarding call to get them set up and introduce them to high-level information about working at Status. You are not expected to give them details from scratch or contact them immediately on their first day.

The following checklist will help establish your relationship and decide how you will use the time spent together moving forward. It includes some suggestions for you to cover throughout your chats:

- [ ] Establish frequency / duration of calls over a suggested 4-6 weeks.
- [ ] Outline your role, experience at Status, what you're working on, and how that ties in with the organization.
- [ ] Explain to them what the buddy program is, and your role as their buddy, and the type of topics you'll be covering in the weekly chats.
- [ ] Walk through the Status app, how to contact people, and send each other messages and ETH/SNT.
- [ ] Find out about their professional background and experience, and what they will be working on/they're excited about contributing.
- [ ] Ask about their experience/comfort level with remote work, decentralized autonomous organizations, open-source, and community-based working.
- [ ] Talk about Status's mission and objectives -- the State of Us, decentralization, the Principles, etc.
- [ ] Discuss the working culture at Status. How is this different from other places the new contributor has contributed?
- [ ] If relevant, introduce them to key people they may benefit from knowing outside of their immediate team.
- [ ] Suggest what to read and other valuable resources for their role or get to know the company in general.
- [ ] Ask them if they're confused about anything and help them figure out the answers they need. If you don't know the answers to some of their questions, it's okay --point them to someone who does, or ping #people-ops so we can look up a solution together.
- [ ] Share some Status channels that they may find interesting to follow.
- [ ] Get to know a bit about them as a person outside of work.
- [ ] Talk about how to dogfood the app, give examples of how they can use it, where to report issues, nightly builds, etc.
- [ ] Ask about their workstation --do they have a comfortable space to work? Are they aware of our coworking allowance?

Make sure they know they can ask you anything regarding Status, and you will be happy to help. It's important to stress this often as new team members often can be afraid to bother, shy, or reluctant to ask at first!
