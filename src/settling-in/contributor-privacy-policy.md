# üîë Contributor Privacy Policy

As you can see from our [principles](https://our.status.im/our-principles/), we take privacy and transparency seriously. We strive to only request necessary and required data and not to hold that data longer than necessary. 

Here is a quick explanation of what data we obtain, how we use that information, and how to update/control that information.

## Policy brief & purpose

This Core Contributor Privacy Policy refers to our commitment to treat the information of employees, contractors, and contributors with the utmost care and confidentiality.

With this policy, we ensure that we gather, store and handle data fairly, transparently and with respect towards individual rights.

## About

As part of our operations, we need to obtain and process information. 

This information includes any offline or online data that makes a person identifiable such as names, addresses, usernames and passwords, digital footprints, photographs, social security numbers, financial data, etc.

Status collects this information in a transparent way and only with the full cooperation and knowledge of interested parties. Once this information is available to us, the following rules apply.

Our data will be:

   * Accurate and kept up-to-date.
   * Collected fairly and for lawful purposes only.
   * Processed by Status within its legal and moral boundaries.
   * Protected against any unauthorized or illegal access by internal or external parties.

Our data will not be:

   * Communicated informally.
   * Stored for more than a specified amount of time.
   * Transferred to organizations that do not have adequate data protection policies.
   * Distributed to any party other than the ones agreed upon by the data's owner (exempting legitimate requests from law enforcement authorities).

In addition to ways of handling the data, Status has direct obligations towards people to whom the data belongs. Specifically, we will:

   * Let people know which of their data is collected.
   * Inform people about how we'll process their data.
   * Inform people about who has access to their information.
   * Allow people to request that we modify, erase, reduce, or correct data contained in our databases.

## Data

   * **You provide:** as part of the recruitment/onboarding process, we may ask you to provide relevant data such as name, contact details, bank account, or wallet address. We may also request social security, identification, passport, or national insurance details where required by law. Depending on your contract with us, you may also provide us details of hours/days worked so that we can compensate you appropriately or verify that we have fulfilled our compliance obligations as your employer.
   * **We obtain:** assessments of your performance during the trial period and on an ongoing basis (based on peer feedback and evidence of work), details of periods of leave taken by you, including holiday, sickness absence, family leave, and the reasons for the leave, and notes of our discussions with you. We endeavor to maintain accurate information.
   * **We store:** pay records, including payslips and invoices; copies of contracts and formal notices/letters relating to your employment/contracting relationship with us.

You can request to see a copy of the data we hold on you. To do so, please get in touch with People Ops to make an access request.

## Use

   * We store most of your data in our HR System (BambooHR). We keep some data (documents, payslips) in a secure Google Drive Folder. We tightly control access to the data to only members of the organization that have a valid reason to access your information (generally - People Ops & Finance).
   * We share the minimum necessary amounts of your data with the following third-party accounting, payroll, benefits, and compliance partners as applicable for statutory filings, benefits, and reporting:

We will delete your data after six years. If you have a question about the data we hold or how we use it, don't hesitate to contact `people-ops@status.im`.
