# ⏳ Self-time management

Status is a results-oriented organization –meaning that we care about your output (services provided), not your input (hours/days worked). 

We don't mandate the days, schedule, or hours that you take to deliver the services –you're free to set your schedule and work from any place (home/coffee shop/coworking space) and timezone as long as they’re delivered within the agreed deadline.

This system might be new to you, and if you'd like some guidance on self-time management or have any concerns about being productive –feel free to chat with anyone on the People Ops team who will be happy to coach you.

## Communicating your availability

If you have a 12-months contract with Status, we recommend being at least 20 days away (plus your local or cultural bank holidays) to disconnect and enjoy time doing things important to you. We expect and encourage you to disconnect as much as you need on top of this. 

There is no need to communicate time off unless it's a full day or longer. Non-linear workdays are fine, as well as traditional schedules. Keep your hours in check for your good, make sure you get proper time away from screens, and turn notifications off your phone when you're offline. You are free to choose your working patterns as long as you meet your deliverables on time at the agreed quality standards. 

Monthly and project rate contractors can invoice us for their agreed amounts in months when they take time off. Your contractor agreement is based on your services provided and does not mandate the time or location where the works are to take place. 

### Create unavailability entries

We record contributors' AFK dates with [Bamboo](https://statusim.bamboohr.com/) to [keep an overview](https://statusim.bamboohr.com/calendar) of who's around in the projects and products to help schedule launches, handoffs, etc.

Bamboo doesn't allow to add an entry directly and insists that all dates entered are 'approved' by People Ops. Please, be assured that that's a workflow we can't amend in the system, and we approve all requests by default. 

You don't need to 'ask' for permission. Just make sure to:

* Communicate to the team lead and people you share in-progress projects with
* Mark your unavailability on your project’s shared calendar (if there is one)
* Coordinate appropriately and re-assign or delegate any piece of work that needs to progress in your absence. You can also use this [handover template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15pbTvWJf0luQflw1aRPtX7q00y89_h948Bf3Q861JDk/edit#gid=0) for temporary/short absences.

### Deleting entries in Bamboo

If you change plans and want to cancel or amend an entry, you can follow [these instructions](https://help.bamboohr.com/hc/en-us/articles/227886287-Update-or-Cancel-a-Time-Off-Request). Only People Ops can delete past entries, so please ping someone from the team, and we'll get it sorted right away!
