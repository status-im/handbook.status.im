# üîï Downtime FAQs

### Public holidays

Given the diversity of cultures and locations at Status, we don't have Status-wide days off. We encourage you to book off your home or local public holidays or the ones close to your heart and beliefs. 

### What happens if I'm out sick?

As a general guideline, short-term sick days that don‚Äôt affect your capacity to meet your commitments are treated as regular time off and don‚Äôt need further action than recording it to Bamboo. 

If you‚Äôre going to be unavailable for a prolonged period of time, you need to coordinate with the team lead and People Ops in order to review and adjust your service agreement accordingly. 

### How does the confidentiality work?

You can record your unavailability without explanation. 

If you tell someone in People Ops about a health or personal issue, that information will be shared within the People Ops group, including Carl and Jarrad. Please, let People Ops know of any specific discussion we should keep off the record (i.e., only between you and the People Ops person you're talking with).

People Ops won't tell other core contributors the specifics of your situation. We will be happy to help you communicate your unavailability period if you need help doing that (mentioning that you are offline unwell, giving no further details).

## üê£ Paternity

First of all, congratulations! üéä We're happy about the new addition(s) to your family!

### Next steps

As soon as you're comfortable sharing the news, please ping `people-ops@status.im` to chat about your plans. It'd be great if you could give as much notice as you can ‚Äìas a rule of thumb, at least equivalent to the amount of days you'll be unavailable (i.e., if you want to take four weeks, let us know four weeks in advance).

We'll do our best to accommodate you. Still, it may not always be possible considering your needs, length, and deliverables. We'll review each request on a case by case basis, involving your team lead.

### SNT distributions

We will pause your SNT distributions when you take a prolonged downtime period. In this case, you will forfeit any SNT distributions that occur during that period.

For short period of time, you will still receive your quarterly SNT distributions as usual.

### Access to tools/accounts

In general, we will keep your access to Google and other centralized accounts open during your downtime.
