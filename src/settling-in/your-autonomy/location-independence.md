# üåè Location independence

Status is a fully remote, location-agnostic organization ‚Äìmeaning that we don‚Äôt mandate the location where the services are to take place, except if you‚Äôre attending a specific event. 

Being location independent means you could decide to move away from where you were first delivering your services, and that's okay. Status can provide you with confirmation of engagement letters if you need them in the process of migrating abroad.

However, we cannot cover the visa/work permit processing or relocation costs as we're location agnostic for work. In case of relocation due to business reasons (i.e., we *really, really* need you to, and you agree to it), we will take care of all the processes and costs involved.

#### What happens if I'm thinking about relocating

Get in touch with People Ops to start a discussion about your relocation plans for potential contract considerations. We are sometimes limited in the number of contracts we can offer to certain locations.

#### If you need company details

If you need to indicate your occupation details on a visa application, please use the Status entity address as your consulting agreement.

Please only refer to Status as your employer if the DE/CH entity formally employs you. Otherwise, you should indicate that you are self-employed or providing services as a freelance contractor, as appropriate.

If you need to indicate a company representative on your application, feel free to contact People Ops for details.
