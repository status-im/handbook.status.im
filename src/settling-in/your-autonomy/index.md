## ðŸ¦‹ Your autonomy

Projects have project leads who coordinate communications and resources. However, contributors donâ€™t have managers, you collaborate directly with other contributors in the project. 

Thereâ€™s a huge amount of autonomy involved, and no one will give you granular detail about what to do, when to do it, and where to do it from. 

When you first join, people ops will connect you with another contributor to help you get familiar with the Status ecosystem. Youâ€™ll have a couple of initial deliverables scoped out by the project lead to ease your onboarding and get you going, but beyond that, youâ€™re expected to define and report on your work, reach out to others to collaborate, and hold yourself accountable to it. 

These are some important areas to successfully collaborate in a remote and asynchronous environment:
* Autonomy: Youâ€™re a self-starter, can handle ambiguity, and you have a good sense of when to start tasks on their own and when to ask for support. 
* Motivation/Attitude: You take initiative and engage with your projects, youâ€™re helpful towards others, ask questions, and regularly seeking to learn more.
* Visibility into work: You communicate clearly and proactively update on deliverables progress, others always know what youâ€™re working on.

As a contributor, you have the autonomy to choose in what project, at what capacity, at which times and from what location youâ€™d like to contribute to Status â€“as long as thereâ€™s mutual agreement with the organization. 

Ideally youâ€™re the kind of person that finds that thrilling, and not too terrifying.
