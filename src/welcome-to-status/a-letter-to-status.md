# ðŸ’œ A letter to Status: context & strategy

> Today, when you are first exposed to Status, you might see an instant messenger and wonder, "What's the big deal? After all itâ€™s just another instant messenger right? What makes Status different and more importantly why should I bother working on it?"
>
> One word: Decentralization
> 
> Decentralization has the potential fundamentally to change the way we organize socially and to rebuild the Internet as it was originally imagined - a commons for innovation. By decentralizing all the things, we are changing the very foundation of civilization, providing a new infrastructural base that impacts everything else above, from our greatest institutions to our daily social interactions.
> 
> Status is our gateway to this new world.
