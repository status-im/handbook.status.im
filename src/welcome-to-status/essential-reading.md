# ðŸ“š Essential reading

We've made a selection of readings that can help give you more context of our vision and culture. 

We've added PDFs whenever possible, but you can also order them and [file a reimbursement](/src/finance/expense-reimbursements.md). Read them at your own pace! We highly recommend you read the first group; the second one is nice to go through but less critical.
