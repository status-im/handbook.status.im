# 🌍 Traveling for Status

Connecting with people in person is such an essential part of the remote working experience at Status. Magic happens when people get together.

Here you'll find helpful information to make your travel abroad experience more efficient while being compliant and accountable to project resources. These guidelines apply to anyone traveling for or sponsored by Status away from their usual working location. 

Some of these points might not apply to offsites as they're usually centrally organized with their particular budget.

Your travel budget comes from your team's budget. If you don't have previous approval or haven't posted your travel plans yet, check out [Events and meetups](/src/perks/events-and-meetups.md) before booking your trip. 

If the travel falls outside your team's budget, talk with your team lead about the event or meeting you're attending and [create a travel request](/src/perks/events-and-meetups.md).


> COVID DISCLAIMER: COVID restrictions make travel more difficult, but it's still possible to make it to some places. Before traveling abroad:
> * Head to the official government pages to understand the risks in a country and the latest restrictions applicable to you, including re-entry requirements.
> * Keep in mind that government guidelines are changing as frequently as every few days and that they can impact your travel plans severely.
> * Consider booking timeframes and select cancellation and insurance policies accordingly.


## 💸 Expenses while traveling

It's hard to cover every case within a guide. We trust you to use your best judgment when traveling for company purposes and proactively report back anything you consider relevant. 

Don't go overboard with spending on bookings, food, and drinks. Keep accountability and transparency in mind. Always ask for receipts and keep them organized. Status will reimburse for all reasonable expenses while traveling. 


### What are reasonable expenses

* Reasonable expenses examples:

   * Flights, ground transportation, accommodation, and workspace, if needed, as described below.
   * A max trip average of $75/day/person for meals. If you're dining together with other colleagues, you can submit one bill - just make sure to add their names in the comments section when you file the expense.
   * Laundry charges for trips longer than five days.
   * Expedited service fees, travel visas, and inoculation fees necessary for the destination.
   * Travel insurance up to 100 USD or EUR per trip if you don't have any. We don't have company-wide travel insurance. There are travel insurance providers (scroll down for references) that can offer one-time rates or packages if you're planning more than one trip. Also, check with your bank, credit card issuer, or your usual insurance company since you might already have travel insurance included in place.

* Non-reimbursable expenses examples:

   * Travel programs, airline upgrades, fast tracks, or premium services.
   * Airline/accommodation no-show, cancellation, or rebooking fees.
   * Convenience products and fees for the use of the gym, spa, and other facilities.
   * Hotel, flights, etc., room service, or in-room movies/entertainment.
   * Mobile, roaming, or hotspot connection fees.
   * Any personal expenses and fines, custom charges, etc.

Whether using a company card or requesting reimbursements, you're responsible for submitting your expenses correctly as a traveler. We currently process expenses together with payroll or invoices. When you're back from your trip, follow the instructions on How to file expenses or get reimbursed for uploading your receipts in a compliant and timely manner to keep our finances healthy. 


> 💡 Pro-tip: if you're traveling with other Status contributors, assign a Trip Owner - someone who is taking care of a smooth end-to-end trip. From preparing and while being there to wrapping things up once you're all back home. It can be you, a team lead, or anyone else! 


## 🛩 Getting there

The standard travel booking process uses [TravelPerk](/src/remote-at-status/how-to-use-travelperk.md) for flights, trains, and accommodation, including Airbnbs. You can create individual or group itineraries. TravelPerk helps find better rates, provides support for travel changes and cancellations, and you can still pay with a personal card, if you want, and expense it. 

You can use your car to drive to the event or meeting location. In this case, you can expense the gas costs. 

We generally discourage using rental cars unless strictly necessary, so if you're thinking about renting one, please check with someone in People Ops first.

Usually, the earlier you plan your trip, the cheaper and better it's going to be. We suggest preparing at least one month ahead to have enough time to communicate your plans and stay within budget. 


### Commuting rates and guidelines

* Sometimes it's more convenient to travel by train or bus within Europe. So keep that in mind as an option when you're looking at routes.
* Flight rates for reference:
   * Short-haul: $200-$500
   * Long haul: $500-$1500
* We usually travel in economy class fare with carry-on luggage included. You can add one checked luggage for trips longer than a week or when you're carrying additional baggage for Status.
* You can reimburse in-flight wifi if you need it for work. No, in-flight entertainment is not reimbursable.
* For moving around, choose the most affordable ground transportation option. In some places, traffic is unpredictable, and public transport is more reliable. In others, car rental, and ride-sharing, such as Uber or local equivalents, are better to move from/to the airport and share the ride with others traveling with you.


> 💡 Pro-tip: in-flight entertainment might be limited. You might want to bring a book or download media, music, or documents offline beforehand. For some people, commutes are great to disconnect or do some reading or focus work.


## 💻 Where to stay and work from

You can use TravelPerk to book your stay at a 3-4 star hotel or Airbnb. We generally recommend hotels for solo or two people trips and Airbnbs for groups or team travel. 

Airbnbs are more practical for spending quality time together and setting a coworking space in the dining or living room than a hotel. It's also more convenient to coordinate meals and share rides to/from the event or airport when we're staying together.


> 💡 Pro-tip: it's a good practice to ask for wifi speed before confirming a booking by requesting a fast.com screenshot from the apartment.


If you're staying in a hotel or traveling with other Status contributors and need a place to work from, check out [Trooptravel](https://discuss.status.im/t/finding-meetup-locations/2218) to get a sense of where it would be possible to meet. You can also find modern cafés with great wifi checking reviews from Google Maps, TripAdvisor, or [Workfrom](https://workfrom.co).


> 💡 Pro-tip: more often than not, we use the same devices with the same chargers, which all end mixed up together. Tag yours! And don't forget about the power adapter. Also, check your roaming plans. Alternatively, there are international prepaid sim cards you can purchase online to stay connected when there's no wifi access. 


## 🚨 Special cases

Suppose you're traveling with people outside the organization, and you're staying with them. In that case, Status can't cover any of their travel costs, but reimburse your flights and the proportional part of your accommodation expenses. 

In case of an emergency (hopefully, there isn't any), we'll use the emergency information previously provided on BambooHR or TravelPerk.
