# üß≥ How to use TravelPerk

Before booking your trip, make sure you're aware of the following information:

* Travel guidelines
* About events and meetups
* Here's how to use TravelPerk, the travel booking platform for everything you need from flights and trains to hotels and Airbnbs when traveling for Status. It will help you plan your itinerary whether you're traveling alone or with other Status contributors.


## Account setup

You'll need to head to the TravelPerk web app and sign in using your Status email to get started. 

1. Complete your profile with your:
2. Travel documents
3. Loyalty programs
4. Train discount cards (if any)
5. Personal payment cards (if you want)
6. Emergency contact (important)
7. Update your profile currency to match your salary
8. Your name and other personal data must match your passport or travel documents.


## Creating an itinerary

1. Start by clicking Create a trip and add yourself and other Status contributors traveling with you to the trip.
2. Note that group trips only work for people traveling from/to the same locations and dates. Otherwise, you'll need to create independent itineraries for each location/date.
3. Search and book flights, trains, or hotels just like any other booking platform: filter, select the type of travel fare or room and add it to your trip.
4. A pop-up will let you know if your choice doesn't match our travel policy. You can find the travel policy for TravelPerk in your profile.
5. If you're looking for an Airbnb or booking for a big group of people, you can use the Concierge feature to have custom support creating the trip.


## Troubleshooting

The Concierge feature on TravelPerk helps with:

* Flight fares
* Airport transfers
* Other requests

There's also chat support by clicking the Help page in the navbar.

If you have questions about the travel policy or the budget for your trip, ping your team lead or the People Ops team using the #travel-request channel on Discord.

Safe and fun travels üí´
