# üåä Time off

Just like athletes have rest days to do their best score, taking time away from work is important to recharge and maintain a healthy work/life balance. Make sure to be at least 20 days away every year (plus your local or cultural bank holidays) to disconnect and enjoy time doing things important to you. We expect and encourage you to disconnect as much as you need on top of this. 

There is no need to log time off unless it's a full day or longer. Non-linear workdays are fine, as well as traditional schedules. Keep your hours in check for your good, make sure you get proper time away from screens, and turn notifications off your phone when you're offline.


## Public holidays

Given the diversity of cultures and locations at Status, we don't have Status-wide days off. We encourage you to book off your home or local public holidays or the ones close to your heart and beliefs. 


## Contractors

Monthly and project rate contractors can invoice us for their agreed amounts in months when they take time off. Your contractor agreement is based on your services provided and does not mandate the time or location where the works are to take place. 

You are free to choose your working patterns as long as you meet your deliverables on time at the agreed quality standards. We base our contracts on output (services provided), not input (hours/days worked).

Contractors working at limited capacity (e.g., capped hours per week, ongoing support, etc.) might have other agreements in this respect. When in doubt, please get in touch with People Ops.


## Employees

Your employment agreements contain a statutory, specified number of holidays per year. We've included them for compliance reasons, but above that, consider yourself having the same freedom as the rest of the team.

Just be extra sure to log your time off in Bamboo. We need that information to run payroll correctly and might also need it to prove that you complied with the statutory minimums to local authorities.


## Logging in time off

We record contributors AFK dates with [Bamboo](https://statusim.bamboohr.com/):

   * For employees - for the reasons above.
   * For contractors - to [keep an overview](https://statusim.bamboohr.com/calendar) of who's around in the projects and products to help schedule launches, handoffs, etc.

Bamboo doesn't allow to add an entry directly and insists that all dates entered are 'approved' by People Ops üòÖ. Please, be assured that that's a workflow we can't amend in the system, and we approve all requests by default.

You don't need to 'ask' for permission. Just make sure to coordinate appropriately with your team and to re-assign and delegate any piece of work that needs to progress in your absence. You can also use this [handover template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15pbTvWJf0luQflw1aRPtX7q00y89_h948Bf3Q861JDk/edit#gid=0) for temporary/short leave.


## Deleting entries in Bamboo

If you change plans and want to cancel or amend an entry, you can follow [these instructions](https://help.bamboohr.com/hc/en-us/articles/227886287-Update-or-Cancel-a-Time-Off-Request). Only People Ops can delete past entries, so please ping someone from the team, and we'll get it sorted right away!
