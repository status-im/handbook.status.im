# üê£ Parental Leave

First of all, congratulations! üéä We're happy about the new addition(s) to your family!

## Next steps

As soon as you're comfortable sharing the news, please ping `people-ops@status.im` to chat about your plans. It'd be great if you could give as much notice as you can ‚Äìas a rule of thumb, at least equivalent to the amount of leave you'll be taking (i.e., if you want to take four weeks' leave, let us know four weeks in advance).

Parental leave regulations differ widely between countries and regions. We'll work together to figure out what would work best for you regarding structure and length for your parental leave and whether you would like to take the period as paid or unpaid.

We'll review each request on a case by case basis, involving your swarm/team lead, and will reach an agreement with you where we will consider:

   * Your preferences.
   * What's appropriate depending on whether you're an employee or contractor ‚Äìemployees generally are eligible for legally mandated parental leave periods, whereas contractors are not.
   * Your current time-off balance.
   * Your team's workload.
   * Your tenure at Status.
   * Your role in the team. Suppose you're leading a swarm or team. In that case, we might need additional planning around how your leave will impact the team's work and potentially finding a replacement contributor to cover for you while you're out.

We'll do our best to accommodate you. Still, it may not always be possible owing to the multiple factors mentioned above. We're open to hearing your ideas about the type of flexibility you might need, i.e., breaking up your parental leave into two blocks.

## Getting prepared for leave

   * Let other contributors you work with closely know about your AFK and how that impacts what you work on together as soon as possible.
   * Make a note of any other team [absences](https://statusim.bamboohr.com/calendar) during your proposed leave period, and think about how you can mitigate disruption to the team's work.
   * Identify and agree on one or more people who will take over your responsibilities for you. Map each of your roles and responsibilities clearly to a covering contributor (i.e., swarm roles, leadership roles).
   * Book your parental leave in the `Time-off` section in Bamboo.
   * Hand over the projects you're running and leave clear written documentation of who will be responsible for what in your absence.
   * Make sure that everyone who needs to be informed knows about the plan you've put in place.

## Tracking time-off in Bamboo

   * For paid parental leave, please use the category `Maternity/Paternity Leave`.
   * For unpaid parental leave, please use `Unpaid Leave`.

If you've split your paid period between paid and unpaid, please break up the two time periods accordingly when tracking your leave.

## Returning to work

Given the remote nature of work, we've found that a soft return after the parental leave period seems to work well for many new parents. 

If you'd like to have a gradual return in this way, that's fine. Please, be sure to factor that into your handover notes and planning so your teammates know your reduced availability when you return to work.

## Illness during parental leave

Suppose you require additional time off due to complications or illness during pregnancy. In that case, you can take that in addition to your scheduled parental leave. 

> üôè We may ask you to provide a doctor's note, depending on the length of the period of illness and our obligations as your client or employer.

## SNT distributions

### For contractors

We will pause your SNT distributions when you take a prolonged leave period ‚Äìi.e., more than three months or a quarter. In this case, you will forfeit any SNT distributions that occur during your period of leave.

You will still receive your quarterly SNT distributions as usual for parental leave periods of less than three months even if the next payout falls during the time that you're AFK.

### For employees

We will determine the payment of your contracted SNT distributions based on applicable local legislation.

## Access to tools/accounts

In general, we will keep your access to Google and other centralized accounts open during your leave.
