# ü©∫ If you're sick

This page has more information on what to do in case you find yourself AFK due to sickness. We hope you feel better soon and wish you a speedy recovery!

## What happens if I'm out sick?

   * Tell your team and any other core contributors you're currently working with.
   * Cancel any meetings in your calendar and, if possible, hand over any in-progress work to another contributor or team member.
   * Add your time off in Bamboo in the `Time Off` tab, using the time-off type `Sick leave`.
   * Mark your AFK on your team's shared calendar (if you have one).
   * If you're taking more than three consecutive days off - ping People Ops. We might need a doctor's note.

## How do sick leave and pay work?

As a general guideline, short-term sick leave is fully paid, up to six weeks in a year‚Äîthough there's no prescriptive rule about this. Employees will receive full pay via payroll, and contractors should bill us for their expected amounts. We base contractor agreements on output (services provided), not input (hours/days worked).

You need to collaborate with People Ops to arrange prolonged periods of sick leave‚Äîlonger than three consecutive days. Many factors are variable, such as your jurisdiction's laws on sick leave and the nature of the sickness itself. So we will need to discuss the specifics of your situation with you to find the best possible solution if you're out for longer. This discussion will also help us make any necessary accommodations to support you in working.

## How does the confidentiality work?

When you tell someone in People Ops about a health or personal issue, that information will be shared within the People Ops group (including Carl/Jarrad). Please, let People Ops know of any specific discussion we should keep off the record (i.e., only between you and the People Ops person you're talking with).

People Ops won't tell other core contributors the specifics of your health issues. We will be happy to help you communicate your sick leave if you need help doing that (mentioning that you are out unwell, giving no further details).

People Ops will keep a copy of any doctor's notes you provide and notes of discussions had with you about sick leave. We will handle that data following our [privacy policy](/src/settling-in/contributor-privacy-policy.md).
